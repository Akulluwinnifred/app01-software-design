SOLID:
  Single Responsbility Principle (SRP):
    - It states that a class should have 
      one reason (responsbility)
      to change (refactoring)
  
  Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):
    - [High level modules] should not depend on [Low level modules],
      instead they should both depend on [Abstraction]

    - Program to an [interface] not an [implementation]

    - [High level modules]
    - [Low level modules]

    - [Abstraction]
    - [Interface]
    - [Implementation]
